# Getting Started with Skyline DataMiner DevOps

Welcome to the Skyline DataMiner DevOps environment!  
This quick-start guide will help you get up and running. It was auto-generated based on the initial project setup during creation.  
For more details and comprehensive instructions, please visit [DataMiner Docs](https://docs.dataminer.services/).

## Enabling the Creation of a DataMiner Application Package

This project was not configured to generate a `.dmapp` file.  
To enable `.dmapp` generation, consider migrating to a multi-artifact DataMiner Application Package as described below.

## Migrating to a Multi-Artifact DataMiner Application Package

If you need to combine additional components in your `.dmapp` file, you should:

1. Open the `EmpowerAS_JKO.csproj` file and ensure the `<GenerateDataminerPackage>` property is set to `False`.

2. Right-click your solution and select **Add > New Project**.

3. Select the **Skyline DataMiner Package Project** template.

Follow the provided **Getting Started** guide in the new project for further instructions.

## Enabling Publishing to the Catalog

This project was created without support for publishing to the DataMiner Catalog.  
To enable this, add a **Skyline DataMiner Package Project** to your solution and follow the **Getting Started** guide provided in that project.
